Built upstream [llvm-project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) toolchain using [tc-build](https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/tc-build) and [a bash script](https://bin.xstefen.dev/Cyl6ul.sh) copied from [proton-clang-build](https://github.com/kdrag0n/proton-clang-build) which was edited/updated for my purposes. 

For ARM(arm), AArch64(arm64), X86(x86_64), built with thinLTO and PGO, binutils included to eliminate separate GCC requirements.

Credits to all linked and upstream authors and teams, thank you for your work and allowing us to use it today.
